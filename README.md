Fitting routines for extracting the phase evolution of quantum dots inside semiconductor loops.<br />
The electron temperature is fixed and the real and imaginary part of q as well as the offset are treated as common fitting parameters.<br />
coulomb_oscillations_analysis.py has been written by Bernard van Heck (https://github.com/bernardvanheck/cb_data_analysis) and is used here for initial peak finding.
